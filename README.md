# Temporal

Provides standard objects and functions for working with dates and times.

**NOTE: The [Polyfill](./polyfill), specification text and documentation are under continuing development and should be understood to be unstable.**

## Overview / Motivation

`Date` has been a long-standing pain point in ECMAScript.
This proposes `Temporal`, a global `Object` that acts as a top-level namespace (like `Math`), that brings a modern date/time API to the ECMAScript language.
For a detailed breakdown of motivations, see:
[Fixing JavaScript Date](https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/09/fixing-javascript-date-getting-started/)

### Principles:

- All Temporal objects are immutable.
- Date values can be represented in local calendar systems, but they should be convertable to and from the [Proleptic Gregorian Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Gregorian_calendar).
- All time-of-day values are based on a standard 24-hour clock.
- [Leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) are not represented.

## Specification Text

The specification text can be found [here](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/).

## Polyfill

A complete polyfill can be found [here](./polyfill).
When viewing the [reference documentation](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html), the polyfill is automatically loaded in your browser, so you can try it out by opening your browser's developer tools.

## Cookbook

A cookbook to help you get started and learn the ins and outs of Temporal is available [here](./docs/cookbook.md)

## API Documentation

Reference documentation and examples are in progress and can be found [here](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/index.html).
